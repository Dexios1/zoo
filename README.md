Object Oriented Implementation of a zoo for Advanced System analysis Class

This is an exercise from a system analysis class I took in undergrad at [Valley View University](https://vvu.edu.gh).
The goal of this exercise was to create a heirachical structure for animaals in a zoo.

This could be much better, knowing what I know now. But I'll leave the code as is for the beauty of history.
